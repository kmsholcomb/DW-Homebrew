## Attain Mastery
When you **level up to 6th level or higher and pick a Master Move**, roll +INT. **On a 13+**, you learn the new Master Move and an additional Advanced Move; **on a 7-12**, you learn the new Master Move; **on a 6-**, you don’t learn the new Master Move—pick an Advanced Move instead.
