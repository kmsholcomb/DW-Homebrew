## Attain Mastery
When you **level up to the 6th level or higher and pick a Master Move**, roll +INT. 

* **On a 13+**, you learn the new Master Move and an additional Advanced Move.
* **On a 7-12**, you learn the new Master Move.
* **On a 6-**, you don’t learn the new Master Move, but you pick an Advanced Move instead.
