### Resupply
When you **decide to buy something**, depending on the item's availability and rarity, the following outcomes apply:

* If it’s something ordinary and readily available in the settlement you’re in, you can buy it at a fair price.

### Struggle as One
When **the GM calls on you to Defy Danger as a group**, the GM describes the challenge that you face. Each player says how their character will Defy Danger and rolls +RELEVANT STAT (per Defy Danger).

* **On a 7-9**, you pull your weight and defy the danger.

If you roll a 6- but someone saves you, don’t mark XP.
