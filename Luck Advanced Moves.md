# Luck Advanced Moves
## Advanced Moves
When gaining a new level, any character may choose  the Advanced Move, Lucky Devil.
### Lucky Devil
You have a blessed destiny that grants you great *Luck*, which is an extra stat for you. Luck has a maximum value of 3. Whenever you Level Up, recover any lost Luck.

At any time when you roll for a move and miss (roll 6 or less), you may lower your Luck by 1 to re-roll. Take the second result, and if it is a 7 or greater, explain how you succeeded only through sheer luck.

When your Luck is zero, you may not lower it further. 

***After you have chosen Lucky Devil, the following Advanced and Master Moves become available to any character.***
### Curiosity
When you put yourself at risk to check something out, ask the GM one question related to the risks and roll +Luck. **On a 10+**, the GM will answer it, as clearly as the circumstances allow; **on a 7-9**, the GM will tell you what more you need to do to find the answer yourself. 
### A Fool and their Money
When you pay exceedingly too much for an item, the GM will tell you something useful and interesting about the item you bought, and you take +1 forward when using itâ€”even though you were swindled. 
### Lucky for You!
When you take damage that was intended for someone else, you get *Advantage* on your next roll. You may not spend Luck to negate this damage. 
### The Mouth of Babes
If you blurt out whatever comes into your head when you Spout Lore, get *Advantage* on your roll. 
## Master Moves
### Supremely Lucky
Your maximum Luck is now 4, instead of 3.

Also, when you **take damage or suffer an ill effect**, you may lower your Luck by 1 to completely ignore it. Describe the comedic, contrived, or outright miraculous circumstances that saved you from harm. 
### Three Stooges
You can lower your Luck by 1 to deal 1d10 damage to an enemy. Describe how you embarrass, humiliate, or accidentally clobber them.
