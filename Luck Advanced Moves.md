# Luck Advanced Moves
## Advanced Moves
When gaining a new level, any character may choose  the Advanced Move, Lucky Devil.
### Lucky Devil
You have a blessed destiny that grants you great *Luck*, which is an extra stat for you. Luck has a maximum value of 3. Whenever you make camp and rest, recover any lost Luck by 1d4 -1 points, up to the maximum.

At any time, when you roll for a move and miss (roll 6 or less), you may lower your Luck by 1 to re-roll. Take the second result, and if it is a 7 or greater, explain how you succeeded only through sheer luck.

When your Luck is zero, you may not lower it further, and you take  -1 to rolls going forward until Luck is recovered. 

**After you have chosen *Lucky Devil*, the following Advanced and Master Moves become available to any character.**
### Curiosity
When you put yourself at risk to check something out, ask the GM any one question related to the risks and roll +Luck. On a 10+, the GM will answer it, as clearly as the circumstances allow. On a 7-9, the GM will tell you what more you need to do to find the answer yourself. 
### A Fool and their Money
When you pay too much for something, the GM will tell you something useful and interesting about the item you bought, and you take +1 forward when using itâ€” even though you were swindled. 
### Lucky for You
When you take damage that was intended for someone else, you get +1 Luck. You may not spend Luck to negate this damage. 
### The Mouth of Babes
If you blurt out whatever comes into your head when you spout lore, take +1 to your roll. 
## Master Moves
### Supremely Lucky
Your maximum Luck is now 4, instead of 3. Also, when you recover lost Luck when resting, add +1 to the roll.

When you take damage, you may lower your Luck by 1 to ignore it. Describe the comedic, contrived, or outright miraculous circumstances that saved you from harm. 
### Three Stooges
You can lower your Luck by 1 to deal 1d10 damage to an enemy. Describe how you embarrass, humiliate, or accidentally clobber them.
