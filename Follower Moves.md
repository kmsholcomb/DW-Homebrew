## Follower Moves
### Do Your Thing
When a **follower acts on your behest**, they can make any basic, special, or travel moves. They potentially gain *Advantage* or *Disadvantage* normally, and might (at the GM’s discretion) get to roll Last Breath if incapacitated.

When you **have a follower make a move that involves rolling +STAT**, roll for them. Instead of +STAT, add +1 if they have at least one applicable tag, or +2 if they’re also *Exceptional*. Otherwise, add +nothing. 
### Order Follower
When you **order or expect a follower to do something dangerous, degrading, or contrary to their Instinct**, roll +Loyalty. **On a 10+**, they do it, as ordered; **on a 7-9**, they do it, but pick one from the following list:

- Decrease the follower’s Loyalty by 1.
- They complain loudly, now or later, and demand something in return.
- Caution, laziness, or fear makes them take longer to get it done.
### Pay Up
When you **pay a follower’s cost**, increase their Loyalty by 1 (to a maximum of +3). The move cannot be made again until you and your follower both Make Camp or until after a few weeks of downtime. 
### Recruit Followers
When you **go looking to hire help**, tell the GM who you’re looking for, phrased in one of the following ways: 

- A group of ______ (porters, guards, minstrels, angry farmers, etc.) 
- A skilled ______ (guide, sage, burglar, bodyguard, etc.) 

A group is a follower like any other, but with the *Group* tag. 

If the GM says you can’t find that hereabouts, start over, or move on. Otherwise, roll +nothing, with *Advantage* if you have a good reputation in these parts. **On a 10+**, they’re yours for the hiring; **on a 7-9**, choose 1 from the following list; **on a 6-**, mark XP, and no one shows. 

- They demand greater compensation, in coin or some other form.
- No one here fits the bill, but you hear of someone elsewhere who does.
- They have a need that must be met first (permission, a favor, etc.).
- They are less than ideal (ask the GM how).
