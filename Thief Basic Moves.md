# Thief Basic Moves
## Trap Expert
When you **spend a moment to survey a dangerous area**, roll+WIS. **On a 10+**, hold 3 *Observations*.; **on a 7–9,** hold 1 *Observation*. Spend your *Observations* 1-for-1 to ask the GM these questions:

* What will trigger the trap or ambush?
* What will happen once it’s triggered?
* How could it be disarmed or thwarted?
* What else should I be on the lookout for?
