# Beast Rider Basic Move
## Control Mount
**When your mount bucks due to fear, injury or shock**, roll +Control. **On a 10+**, you remain mounted. **On a 7-9**, you become unhorsed, and your mount leaves the scene but will not go so far that you cannot mount it again when the danger has passed. **On a 6-**, your mount also becomes too injured, tired or frightened to carry you until it has received care and rest when you Make Camp. 

# Beast Rider Advanced Moves
When you ride as if born in the saddle, or train a beast yourself, and form a special bond with your mount you may take one of these moves when you level up.
## Steady Now!
**When a beast you are riding attempts to buck you off**, you may add your DEX modifier to your Control Mount roll. **When you add +STR or +CON to a roll while on a mount**, you may optionally add your Control stat instead.
## Come to Me!
**When you whistle loudly for your mount when it is not nearby**, it will quickly arrive at your side in a dramatic fashion.
## Beast Bond
**When you form a special connection with a particular riding beast**, you and it establish a perfect bond of trust. The beast will never attempt to buck you off no matter the danger, and whenever it suffers harm while you ride it you take it for yourself.

**While you ride this beast**, its Control stat is increased by 1. Should the beast die, you may reform a bond with a different beast after some time in mourning.

### Bugle
Your mount is capable of making deep, loud bugling sounds, which can be heard for miles. It will make this noise at your command, allowing you to send basic messages, if you set up a system in advance. 
## Gryphon
*Large*, Control +2, *Flying*, 2 Passengers 
### King of the Creatures
**When you wish to impress or frighten someone while riding this mount**, roll +CHA. **On a 7-9**, they do one of the following: 
* They are impressed and will treat you with respect 
* They cower in fear and will not meet your eyes 
* They attack or insult you
**On a 10+**, also gain this mount’s Control stat as +forward against them.
### Royal Guardian
**When you Defend someone while riding this mount**, on a 7+, add this mount’s Control stat to the amount of hold you gain.
### Proud Beast
You never need to Control your Mount as a result of fear or injury. However, if you offend this mount or hurt its pride, you are automatically dismounted, and your mount will not allow you to ride it again until you’ve made appropriate reconciliation.
