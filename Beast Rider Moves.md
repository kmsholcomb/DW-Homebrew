# Beast Rider Basic Move
## Control Mount
When your **mount bucks due to fear, injury, or shock**, roll +Control. **On a 10+**, you remain mounted. **On a 7-9**, you are bucked off your mount, and your mount moves away, but not so far that you cannot mount it again after the danger has passed. **On a 6-**, your mount also becomes too injured, tired, or frightened to carry you until it has received care and rest when you Make Camp. 

# Beast Rider Advanced Moves
When you ride as if born in the saddle or train a beast yourself, you may take one of these Advanced Moves when you level up.
## Steady Now!
When your **mount attempts to buck you off**, you may add your DEX modifier to your Control Mount roll.

Also, when you **add +STR or +CON to a roll while mounted**, you may optionally add your mount’s Control instead.
## Come to Me!
When you **whistle loudly for your mount when it is not nearby**, it will quickly arrive at your side in a dramatic fashion.
## Beast Whisperer
You can **form a special connection with a particular mount** and establish a perfect bond of trust with it. The mount will never attempt to buck you off no matter the danger and whenever it suffers harm while you ride it, you can optionally take it yourself. When you **ride this mount**, its Control stat is increased by 1. Should the mount die, you may reform a bond with a new mount after some time in mourning.
