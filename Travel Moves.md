## Travel Moves
#Ironlands Campaign Homebrew 1.2#
#Dungeon World/Moves#
### Chart a Course
When you **plot the best path through dangerous or unfamiliar territory**, roll +INT. **On a 10+**, you make good time, covering more ground ; **on a 7-9**, you make about as much progress as expected. 
### Forage
When you **spend a day seeking food in the wild**, roll +WIS. **On a 10+**, acquire 1d6 rations, and choose 1 from the following list; **on a 7-9**,  choose 1:

* You discover something interesting or useful.
* You avoid challenge, risk, and danger (*otherwise, you must deal with some.*)
* Acquire an extra 1d4 rations. 
### Make Camp
When you **settle in to rest**, each member of the party must consume 1 ration.
 
If you **get at least a few hours of sleep**, choose 1 from the following list:

* Regain HP equal to ½ of your  maximum.
* Clear a debility.
* Gain *Advantage* on your next roll.
### Scout Ahead
When you **take point and look for anything out of the ordinary**, roll +WIS. **On a 10+**, choose 2 from the following list; **on a 7-9**, choose 1:

* You get the drop on whatever lies ahead.
* You discern a beneficial aspect of the terrain—shortcut, shelter, or tactical advantage (describe it).
* You make a Discovery (ask the GM) .
* You see sign of a nearby Danger (ask the GM) .
### Take Watch
When you **are on watch and something approaches**, roll +WIS. **On a 10+**, you notice in time to alert everyone and prepare, granting all party members *Advantage* for the encounter; **on a 7-9**, you react in time to sound the alarm, but nothing else. 
### Undertake a Perilous Journey
When you **travel through hostile territory**, to a known location, choose one member of the party one to *scout* ahead, one to act as *trailblazer*, and one to be *quartermaster*. Each character rolls+WIS.** **On a 10+**:

* The scout will spot any trouble quickly enough to let you get the  drop on it,
* The trailblazer reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your  destination (the GM will say by how much), and
* The quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by one. 

**On a 7–9**, each role performs their job as expected: no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either, the journey takes about as long as expected, and the normal number of rations are consumed.
### Weather—Hunker Down
When you **take shelter to wait out severe weather**, roll +nothing. **On 10+**, it doesn’t take long for things to clear up.;**on 7-9**, things aren’t going to change any time soon—you can Forge Ahead or Make Camp and hope things have changed by morning. 
### Weather—Forge Ahead
When you **push on despite severe weather,** roll +CON. **On a 10+**, you continue your journey without undo mishap due to the weather; **on a 7-9**, choose 1 from the following list:

* You continue your journey, but overtax yourself and become *weak*, *shaky*, or *sick* (choose one).
* You continue your journey, but the weather takes a deep toll on your gear (ask the GM how). 
* On second thought, maybe you’re better off staying put.
