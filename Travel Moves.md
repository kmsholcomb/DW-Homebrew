## Travel Moves

### Forage
When you **spend a day seeking food in the wild**, roll +WIS. **On a 10+**, acquire 1d4 rations, and choose one outcome from the following list. **On a 7-9**, choose one outcome.

* You discover something interesting or useful.
* You avoid challenge, risk, and danger (*otherwise, you must deal with some*).
* Acquire an extra 1d4 rations. 

### Make Camp
When you **settle in to rest**, each member of the party consumes 1 ration.
 
If you **get at least a few hours of sleep**, choose one outcome from the following list:

* You regain lost HP equal to half of your maximum HP.
* You heal a Debility.
* You gain *Advantage* on your next roll.

### Take Watch
When you **are on watch and something approaches**, roll +WIS. 

* **On a 10+**, you notice in time to alert everyone and prepare, granting all party members *Advantage* for the encounter.
* **On a 7-9**, you react in time to sound the alarm, but nothing else. 

### Undertake a Perilous Journey
When you **travel to a location that you've been to before and the journey is dangerous**, choose one member of the party be a *scout*, one to be a *navigator*, and one to be *quartermaster*. Each character rolls +WIS. 

* **On a 10+**:
    * Scout: Spots any trouble quickly enough to let you get the drop on it.
    * Navigator: Reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much).
    * Quartermaster: Reduces the number of rations required by one. 
* **On a 7–9**, the role performs their job as expected:
    * Scout: No one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either.
    * Navigator: The journey takes about as long as expected.
    * Quartermaster: The normal number of rations are consumed.

### Weather—Hunker Down
When you **take shelter to wait out severe weather**, roll +0. 

* **On 10+**, it doesn't take long for the weather to clear up.
* **On 7-9**, the weather isn't going to stop any time soon. You can Forge Ahead, or you can Make Camp and hope things have changed by morning. 

### Weather—Forge Ahead
When you **push on despite severe weather,** roll +CON. **On a 10+**, you continue your journey without undo mishap due to the weather. **On a 7-9**, choose one outcome from the following list:

* You continue your journey but overtax yourself and become *weak*, *shaky*, or *sick* (choose one).
* You continue your journey, but the weather takes a deep toll on your gear (ask the GM how).
