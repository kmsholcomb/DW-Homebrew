## Basic Moves

### Aid
When you **help another player character (PC) before they roll their move**, either they can accomplish more than they could have alone or you grant them *Advantage* on their roll.

By aiding, you are exposed to any risk, cost, or consequence associated with their roll. 
### Defend
When you **take up a defensive stance or protect a person, place, or thing**, roll +CON. **On a 10+**, hold 3 points of *Readiness*; **on a 7-9**, hold 1 point of *Readiness*. You can spend each point of *Readiness* on the following actions:

* Suffer an attack’s damage/effects, instead of the entity that you're defending.
* Halve an attack’s damage/effects.
* Draw all attention from the entity that you're defending to yourself.
* Strike back at the attacker, hitting automatically and dealing damage with *Disadvantage*.

When **you go on the offensive, you stop defending, or the danger passes**, you lose any remaining points of *Readiness* that you hold.

### Defy Danger
When **the stakes are high, danger looms, and you act anyway**, roll with the relevant modifier:

* +STR to power through or test your might
* +DEX to employ speed, agility, or finesse
* +CON to endure or hold steady
* +INT to apply quick wit or expertise, or enact a clever plan
* +WIS to exert willpower or rely on your senses
* +CHA to charm, bluff, impress, or fit in

**On a 10+**, you pull it off as well as one could hope; **on a 7-9**, you can do it, but the GM will present a lesser success, a cost, or a consequence (and maybe a choice between them, or a chance to back down.)

### Discern Realities
When you **closely study a situation or person**, you can ask the GM one of the following questions:

* What happened here recently?
* What is about to happen?
* What (else) should I be on the lookout for?
* What here is (most) useful or valuable to me?
* Who or what is really in control here?
* What here is not what it appears to be?

If the answer is obvious, the **GM answers honestly**. If **the answer isn’t obvious**, roll +WIS. **On a 7+**, the GM answers honestly; **on a 10+**, also hold 2 points of *Insight*. You can spend each point of *Insight* on the following actions:

* Ask another question about the situation from the list, and get an honest answer.
* Gain *Advantage* on a roll that you make to act on the GM’s answers.

### Hack & Slash
When you **fight in melee or close quarters**, roll +STR. **On a 10+**, your maneuver works as intended, you deal your damage, and you choose one of the following actions:

* Evade, prevent, or otherwise counter the enemy’s reprisal.
* Roll your damage again, but suffer the enemy’s reprisal.

**On a 7-9**, your maneuver mostly works, and you deal your damage. However, you suffer the enemy’s reprisal.

**Notes**:

- When your **attack could hurt multiple enemies**, roll Hack & Slash once, but roll damage separately for each enemy.
- When you **gang up on an enemy**, only one of you rolls Hack & Slash, and the others Aid. If you deal damage, one of you rolls your damage with *Advantage*, and then adds +1 damage per attacker after the first.

### Interfere
When you try **to foil another PC’s action and neither of you backs down**, roll with the relevant modifier: 

* +STR to power through or test your might
* +DEX to employ speed, agility, or finesse
* +CON to endure or hold steady
* +INT to apply quick wit or expertise, or enact a clever plan
* +WIS to exert willpower or rely on your senses
* +CHA to charm, bluff, impress, or fit in

**On a 10+**, the PC you're interfering with chooses one action from the following list, and you still have options. **On a 7-9**, they choose one action, but you have no further options. 

* Do it anyway, but with *Disadvantage* on their next roll.
* Relent, change course, or otherwise allow their move to be foiled.

### Parley
When you **press or entice a nonplayer character (NPC)**, say what you want them to do (or not do). If they have no reason to resist, they comply. If they have a reason to resist, roll +CHA. **On a 10+**, they either do as you want or reveal the easiest way to convince them; **on a 7-9**, they reveal something you can do to convince them, but it’ll be costly, tricky, or distasteful.

**Note**: Parley against a PC is experimental and needs further discussion.
> When you **press or entice a PC and they resist**, you can roll +CHA. **On a 10+**, choose two outcomes from the following list; **on a 7-9**, choose one.

>* If they do what you want, they gain a point of XP. 
>* They must do what you want, or reveal how you could convince them to do so.

### Spout Lore
When you **consult your accumulated knowledge about something**, roll +INT. **On a 10+**, the GM tells you something interesting, useful, and relevant about the subject. **On a 7-9**, the GM tells you something interesting—it’s up to you to make it useful or relevant. 

### Volley
When you **launch a ranged attack**, roll +DEX. **On a 10+**, you have a clear shot and you deal your damage. **On a 7-9**, deal your damage, but choose one of the following outcomes:

* You have to move or hold steady to get the shot, placing you in danger as described by the GM.
* You have *Disadvantage* on your damage roll.
* You deplete 1 ammo.
