## Basic Moves
#Ironlands Campaign Homebrew 1.2#
#Dungeon World/Moves#
### Aid
When you **help another PC who has not yet rolled**, either they can accomplish more than they could have alone or you grant them *Advantage * on their roll.

By aiding, you are exposed to any risk, cost, or consequence associated with their roll. 
### Defend
When you **take up a defensive stance or jump in to protect others**, roll +CON: **on a 10+**, hold 3 *Readiness *; **on a 7-9**, hold 1 *Readiness *. You can spend Readiness 1-for-1 to:

* Suffer an attack’s damage/effects instead of your ward.
* Halve an attack’s damage/effects.
* Draw all attention from your ward to yourself.
* Strike back at an attacker (deal damage, with *Disadvantage*.

When you **go on the offense, cease to focus on defense, or the danger passes**, lose any *Readiness* that you hold.
### Defy Danger
When **the stakes are high, danger looms, and you act anyway**, roll…

* +STR to power through or test your might.
* +DEX to employ speed, agility, or finesses.
* +CON to endure or hold steady.
* +INT to apply expertise or enact a clever plan.
* +WIS to exert willpower or rely on your senses.
* +CHA to charm, bluff, impress, or fit in.

**On a 10+**, you pull it off as as one could hope; **on a 7-9**, you can do it, but the GM will present a lesser success, a cost, or a consequence (and maybe a choice between them, or a chance to back down.)
### Discern Realities
When you **closely study a situation or person**, you can ask the GM one of the following:

* What happened here recently?
* What is about to happen?
* What (else) should I be on the lookout for?
* What here is (most) useful or valuable to me?
* Who or what is really in control here?
* What here is not what it appears to be?

If **the answer isn’t obvious**, roll +WIS: **on a 7+**, the GM will answer honestly; **on a 10+**, also hold 2 *Insight*. You can spend *Insight* 1-for-1 to:

* Ask another question about the situation from the list above, and get an honest answer.
* Gain *Advantage* on a roll you make to act on the GM’s answer(s).
### Hack & Slash
When you **fight in melee or close quarters**, roll +STR: **on a 10+**,your maneuver works as expected (deal your damage) and choose 1 from the following list:

* Evade, prevent, or counter the enemy’s attack.
* Roll damage with *Advantage*, then add +1d6 extra, but suffer the enemy’s attack.

*On a 7-9*, your maneuver works, mostly (deal your damage) but suffer the enemy’s attack.

**Notes**:

- When **your attack could hurt multiple foes**, roll *Hack & Slash* once, but roll damage separately for each foe.
- When **you gang up on a foe**, only one of you rolls *Hack & Slash*, and the others *Aid*. If you deal damage, one of you rolls your damage with *Advantage*, and then add +1 damage per attacker after the first.
### Interfere
When you try **to foil another PC’s action and neither of you back down***, roll... 

* +STR to power through or test your might.
* +DEX to employ speed, agility, or finesses.
* +CON to endure or hold steady.
* +INT to apply expertise or enact a clever plan.
* +WIS to exert willpower or rely on your senses.
* +CHA to charm, bluff, impress, or fit in.

**On a 10+**, they choose 1 from the following list; **on a 7-9**, they choose 1 but you are left off balance, exposed, or otherwise vulnerable. 

* Do it anyway, but with *Disadvantage* on their (next) roll.
* Relent, change course, or otherwise allow their move to be foiled.
### Parley
When you **press or entice an NPC**, say what you want them to do (or not do). If they have reason to resist, roll +CHA: **on a 10+**,they either do as you want or reveal the easiest way to convince them; **on a 7-9**, they reveal something you can do to convince them, though it’ll likely be costly, tricky, or distasteful.

When you **press or entice a PC and they resist**, you can roll +CHA: **on a 10+**,choose 2 from the following list; **on a 7-9**, choose 1:

* They mark XP if they do what you want 
* They must do what you want, or reveal how you could convince them to do so.
### Spout Lore
When you **consult your accumulated knowledge about something**, roll +INT: **on a 10+**,the GM will tell you something interesting, useful, and relevant about the subject; **on a 7-9**, the GM will only tell you some- thing interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. 
### Volley
When you **launch a ranged attack**, roll +DEX: **on a 10+**,you have a clear shot—deal your damage; **on a 7-9**, deal your damage, but choose 1 from the following list:

* You have to move or hold steady to get the shot, placing you in danger as described by the GM.
* Take what you can get; you have *Disadvantage* on your damage roll.
* Deplete 1 ammo.
